Sometimes you want to search for a string in the text 
and add an auto incremented number to each occurence of the string. 
Let's say, you want to make a numbered list. 
You write something like:
qwerty: The first line
qwerty: the second one
qwerty: and so on ...
Then you type a command
:let I=0
followed by a replace command
:%s/qwerty/\=INC(1)/
The first 'qwerty' is replaced by number 1, 
the second by number 2, and so on... .
Sometimes you might want to generate numbers with a leadimg zeroes. 
You simply initialize global variable I to value like 
:let I=99890000
then you make the replacement 
:%s/my_token_word/\=INC(1)/g
followed by
:%s/9989//g

You have to initialize a global variable I 
before the first use of INC() function,
othervise the numbering will continue where it stopped 
during the last replace.

Text Pad has a very similar metacharacter for replacement - \i.
